Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites of significance for the global persistence
of biodiversity. They are identified using eleven criteria, published in an [IUCN
standard for the identification of KBAs](https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259),
and can be identified for species, ecosystems and sites of outstanding ecological integrity.
KBAs can be identified by any individual and proposed online at the
[KBA website](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/). The KBA Scoping portal is a tool
to help proposers identify potential KBA trigger species for specific sites defined
by a polygon shapefile, thereby providing a short list of species that need to be
assessed for a site. Details on how the tool works and how to interpret the results
is given in the Metadata and Interpretation of results files.
